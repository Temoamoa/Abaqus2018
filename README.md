# Abaqus2018
I am trying to change the environment variables in the win86_64.env. 
I cannot work on the Abaqus 2017 because the licence is expired. 
And I have tried several things to work but none worked (as deleting -I%I or looking for files in \Program Files\Dassault Systemes\SimulationServices\V6R2018x\win_b64\code\include) to understand the following errors.
Errors appear in the std_user.log.

gfortran: error: /I.: No such file or directory
gfortran: error: /IC:\Program Files\Dassault Systemes\SimulationServices\V6R2018x\win_b64\code\include: Invalid argument
gfortran: error: /IC:\Program Files\Dassault Systemes\SimulationServices\V6R2018x\win_b64\..\SMAUsubs\PublicInterfaces: Invalid argument
